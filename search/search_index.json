            "text": "Ethereum and complex blockchain programs are new and highly experimental. Therefore, you should expect constant changes in the security landscape, as new bugs and security risks are discovered, and new best practices are developed. Following the security practices in this document is therefore only the beginning of the security work you will need to do as a smart contract developer.\n\n\nSmart contract programming requires a different engineering mindset than you may be used to. The cost of failure can be high, and change can be difficult, making it in some ways more similar to hardware programming or financial services programming than web or mobile development. It is therefore not enough to defend against known vulnerabilities. Instead, you will need to learn a new philosophy of development:\n\n\nPrepare for failure\n\n\nAny non-trivial contract will have errors in it. Your code must, therefore, be able to respond to bugs and vulnerabilities gracefully.\n\n\n\n\nPause the contract when things are going wrong ('circuit breaker')\n\n\nManage the amount of money at risk (rate limiting, maximum usage)\n\n\nHave an effective upgrade path for bugfixes and improvements\n\n\n\n\nRollout carefully\n\n\nIt is always better to catch bugs before a full production release.\n  - Test contracts thoroughly, and add tests whenever new attack vectors are discovered\n  - Provide \nbug bounties\n starting from alpha testnet releases\n  - Rollout in phases, with increasing usage and testing in each phase\n\n\nKeep contracts simple\n\n\nComplexity increases the likelihood of errors.\n\n\n\n\nEnsure the contract logic is simple\n\n\nModularize code to keep contracts and functions small\n\n\nUse already-written tools or code where possible (eg. don't roll your own random number generator)\n\n\nPrefer clarity to performance whenever possible\n\n\nOnly use the blockchain for the parts of your system that require decentralization\n\n\n\n\nStay up to date\n\n\nUse the resources listed in the next section to keep track of new security developments.\n\n\n\n\nCheck your contracts for any new bug that's discovered\n\n\nUpgrade to the latest version of any tool or library as soon as possible\n\n\nAdopt new security techniques that appear useful\n\n\n\n\nBe aware of blockchain properties\n\n\nWhile much of your programming experience will be relevant to Ethereum programming, there are some pitfalls to be aware of.\n\n\n\n\nBe extremely careful about external contract calls, which may execute malicious code and change control flow.\n\n\nUnderstand that your public functions are public, and may be called maliciously.

The general recommendation for any smart contract system is to identify the proper balance for these fundamental tradeoffs.\n\n\nAn ideal smart contract system from a software engineering bias is modular, reuses code instead of duplicating it, and supports upgradeable components.  An ideal smart contract system from a secure architecture bias may share this mindset, especially in the case of more complex smart contract systems.\n\n\nHowever, there are important exceptions where security and software engineering best practices may not be aligned.  In each case, the proper balance is obtained by identifying the optimal mix of properties along contract system dimensions such as:\n\n\n\n\nRigid versus Upgradeable\n\n\nMonolithic versus Modular\n\n\nDuplication versus Reuse\n\n\n\n\nRigid versus Upgradeable\n\n\nWhile multiple resources, including this one, emphasize malleability characteristics such as Killable, Upgradeable or Modifiable patterns there is a \nfundamental tradeoff\n between malleability and security.\n\n\nMalleability patterns by definition add complexity and potential attack surfaces.  Simplicity is particularly effective over complexity in cases where the smart contract system performs a very limited set of functionality for a pre-defined limited period of time, for example, a governance-free finite-time-frame token-sale contract system.\n\n\nMonolithic versus Modular\n\n\nA monolithic self-contained contract keeps all knowledge locally identifiable and readable.  While there are few smart contract systems held in high regard that exist as monoliths, there is an argument to be made for extreme locality of data and flow - for example, in the case of optimizing code review efficiency.\n\n\nAs with the other tradeoffs considered here, security best practices trend away from software engineering best practices in simple short-lived contracts and trend toward software engineering best practices in the case of more complex perpetual contract systems.\n\n\nDuplication versus Reuse\n\n\nA smart contract system from a software engineering perspective wishes to maximize reuse where reasonable.  There are many ways to reuse contract code in Solidity.  Using proven previously-deployed contracts \nwhich you own\n is generally the safest manner to achieve code reuse.\n\n\nDuplication is frequently relied upon in cases where self-owned previously-deployed contracts are not available.  Efforts such as \nLive Libs\n and \nZeppelin Solidity\n seek to provide patterns such that secure code can be re-used without duplication.  Any contract security analyses must include any re-used code that has not previously established a level of trust commensurate with the funds at risk in the target smart contract system.",

            "text": "This page demonstrates a number of solidity patterns which should generally be followed when writing smart contracts.\n\n\nProtocol specific recommendations\n\n\n\n\nThe following recommendations apply to the development of any contract system on Ethereum.\n\n\nExternal Calls\n\n\nUse caution when making external calls\n\n\nCalls to untrusted contracts can introduce several unexpected risks or errors. External calls may execute malicious code in that contract \nor\n any other contract that it depends upon. As such, every external call should be treated as a potential security risk. When it is not possible, or undesirable to remove external calls, use the recommendations in the rest of this section to minimize the danger.\n\n\nMark untrusted contracts\n\n\nWhen interacting with external contracts, name your variables, methods, and contract interfaces in a way that makes it clear that interacting with them is potentially unsafe. This applies to your own functions that call external contracts.\n\n\n// bad\n\n\nBank\n.\nwithdraw\n(\n100\n);\n \n// Unclear whether trusted or untrusted\n\n\n\nfunction\n \nmakeWithdrawal\n(\nuint\n \namount\n)\n \n{\n \n// Isn\nt clear that this function is potentially unsafe\n\n    \nBank\n.\nwithdraw\n(\namount\n);\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n// good\n\n\nUntrustedBank\n.\nwithdraw\n(\n100\n);\n \n// untrusted external call\n\n\nTrustedBank\n.\nwithdraw\n(\n100\n);\n \n// external but trusted bank contract maintained by XYZ Corp\n\n\n\nfunction\n \nmakeUntrustedWithdrawal\n(\nuint\n \namount\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nUntrustedBank\n.\nwithdraw\n(\namount\n);\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nAvoid state changes after external calls\n\n\nWhether using \nraw calls\n (of the form \nsomeAddress.call()\n) or \ncontract calls\n (of the form \nExternalContract.someMethod()\n), assume that malicious code might execute. Even if \nExternalContract\n is not malicious, malicious code can be executed by any contracts \nit\n calls. \n\n\nOne particular danger is malicious code may hijack the control flow, leading to race conditions. (See \nRace Conditions\n for a fuller discussion of this problem).\n\n\nIf you are making a call to an untrusted external contract, \navoid state changes after the call\n. This pattern is also sometimes known as the \nchecks-effects-interactions pattern\n.\n\n\nBe aware of the tradeoffs between \nsend()\n, \ntransfer()\n, and \ncall.value()()\n\n\nWhen sending ether be aware of the relative tradeoffs between the use of\n\nsomeAddress.send()\n, \nsomeAddress.transfer()\n, and \nsomeAddress.call.value()()\n.\n\n\n\n\nsomeAddress.send()\nand \nsomeAddress.transfer()\n are considered \nsafe\n against \nreentrancy\n.\n    While these methods still trigger code execution, the called contract is\n    only given a stipend of 2,300 gas which is currently only enough to log an\n    event.\n\n\nx.transfer(y)\n is equivalent to \nrequire(x.send(y));\n, it will automatically revert if the send fails.\n\n\nsomeAddress.call.value(y)()\n will send the provided ether and trigger code execution.\n\n    The executed code is given all available gas for execution making this type of value transfer \nunsafe\n against reentrancy.\n\n\n\n\nUsing \nsend()\n or \ntransfer()\n will prevent reentrancy but it does so at the cost of being incompatible with any contract whose fallback function requires more than 2,300 gas. It is also possible to use \nsomeAddress.call.value(ethAmount).gas(gasAmount)()\n to forward a custom amount of gas.\n\n\nOne pattern that attempts to balance this trade-off is to implement both\na \npush\n and \npull\n mechanism, using \nsend()\n or \ntransfer()\n\nfor the \npush\n component and \ncall.value()()\n for the \npull\n component.\n\n\nIt is worth pointing out that exclusive use of \nsend()\n or \ntransfer()\n for value transfers\ndoes not itself make a contract safe against reentrancy but only makes those\nspecific value transfers safe against reentrancy.\n\n\nHandle errors in external calls\n\n\nSolidity offers low-level call methods that work on raw addresses: \naddress.call()\n, \naddress.callcode()\n, \naddress.delegatecall()\n, and \naddress.send()\n. These low-level methods never throw an exception, but will return \nfalse\n if the call encounters an exception. On the other hand, \ncontract calls\n (e.g., \nExternalContract.doSomething()\n) will automatically propagate a throw (for example, \nExternalContract.doSomething()\n will also \nthrow\n if \ndoSomething()\n throws).\n\n\nIf you choose to use the low-level call methods, make sure to handle the possibility that the call will fail, by checking the return value.\n\n\n// bad\n\n\nsomeAddress\n.\nsend\n(\n55\n);\n\n\nsomeAddress\n.\ncall\n.\nvalue\n(\n55\n)();\n \n// this is doubly dangerous, as it will forward all remaining gas and doesn\nt check for result\n\n\nsomeAddress\n.\ncall\n.\nvalue\n(\n100\n)(\nbytes4\n(\nsha3\n(\ndeposit()\n)));\n \n// if deposit throws an exception, the raw call() will only return false and transaction will NOT be reverted\n\n\n\n// good\n\n\nif\n(\n!\nsomeAddress\n.\nsend\n(\n55\n))\n \n{\n\n    \n// Some failure code\n\n\n}\n\n\n\nExternalContract\n(\nsomeAddress\n).\ndeposit\n.\nvalue\n(\n100\n);\n\n\n\n\n\nFavor \npull\n over \npush\n for external calls\n\n\nExternal calls can fail accidentally or deliberately. To minimize the damage caused by such failures, it is often better to isolate each external call into its own transaction that can be initiated by the recipient of the call. This is especially relevant for payments, where it is better to let users withdraw funds rather than push funds to them automatically. (This also reduces the chance of \nproblems with the gas limit\n.)  Avoid combining multiple \nsend()\n calls in a single transaction.\n\n\n// bad\n\n\ncontract\n \nauction\n \n{\n\n    \naddress\n \nhighestBidder\n;\n\n    \nuint\n \nhighestBid\n;\n\n\n    \nfunction\n \nbid\n()\n \npayable\n \n{\n\n        \nrequire\n(\nmsg\n.\nvalue\n \n=\n \nhighestBid\n);\n\n\n        \nif\n \n(\nhighestBidder\n \n!=\n \n0\n)\n \n{\n\n            \nhighestBidder\n.\ntransfer\n(\nhighestBid\n);\n \n// if this call consistently fails, no one else can bid\n\n        \n}\n\n\n       \nhighestBidder\n \n=\n \nmsg\n.\nsender\n;\n\n       \nhighestBid\n \n=\n \nmsg\n.\nvalue\n;\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n// good\n\n\ncontract\n \nauction\n \n{\n\n    \naddress\n \nhighestBidder\n;\n\n    \nuint\n \nhighestBid\n;\n\n    \nmapping\n(\naddress\n \n=\n \nuint\n)\n \nrefunds\n;\n\n\n    \nfunction\n \nbid\n()\n \npayable\n \nexternal\n \n{\n\n        \nrequire\n(\nmsg\n.\nvalue\n \n=\n \nhighestBid\n);\n\n\n        \nif\n \n(\nhighestBidder\n \n!=\n \n0\n)\n \n{\n\n            \nrefunds\n[\nhighestBidder\n]\n \n+=\n \nhighestBid\n;\n \n// record the refund that this user can claim\n\n        \n}\n\n\n        \nhighestBidder\n \n=\n \nmsg\n.\nsender\n;\n\n        \nhighestBid\n \n=\n \nmsg\n.\nvalue\n;\n\n    \n}\n\n\n    \nfunction\n \nwithdrawRefund\n()\n \nexternal\n \n{\n\n        \nuint\n \nrefund\n \n=\n \nrefunds\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n];\n\n        \nrefunds\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n]\n \n=\n \n0\n;\n\n        \nmsg\n.\nsender\n.\ntransfer\n(\nrefund\n);\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't assume contracts are created with zero balance\n\n\nAn attacker can send wei to the address of a contract before it is created.  Contracts should not assume that its initial state contains a zero balance.  See \nissue 61\n for more details.\n\n\nRemember that on-chain data is public\n\n\nMany applications require submitted data to be private up until some point in time in order to work. Games (eg. on-chain rock-paper-scissors) and auction mechanisms (eg. sealed-bid second-price auctions) are two major categories of examples. If you are building an application where privacy is an issue, take care to avoid requiring users to publish information too early.\n\n\nExamples:\n\n\n\n\nIn rock paper scissors, require both players to submit a hash of their intended move first, then require both players to submit their move; if the submitted move does not match the hash throw it out.\n\n\nIn an auction, require players to submit a hash of their bid value in an initial phase (along with a deposit greater than their bid value), and then submit their action bid value in the second phase.\n\n\nWhen developing an application that depends on a random number generator, the order should always be (1) players submit moves, (2) random number generated, (3) players paid out. The method by which random numbers are generated is itself an area of active research; current best-in-class solutions include Bitcoin block headers (verified through \nhttp://btcrelay.org\n), hash-commit-reveal schemes (ie. one party generates a number, publishes its hash to \"commit\" to the value, and then reveals the value later) and \nRANDAO\n.\n\n\nIf you are implementing a frequent batch auction, a hash-commit scheme is also desirable.\n\n\n\n\nIn 2-party or N-party contracts, beware of the possibility that some participants may \"drop offline\" and not return\n\n\nDo not make refund or claim processes dependent on a specific party performing a particular action with no other way of getting the funds out. For example, in a rock-paper-scissors game, one common mistake is to not make a payout until both players submit their moves; however, a malicious player can \"grief\" the other by simply never submitting their move - in fact, if a player sees the other player's revealed move and determines that they lost, they have no reason to submit their own move at all. This issue may also arise in the context of state channel settlement. When such situations are an issue, (1) provide a way of circumventing non-participating participants, perhaps through a time limit, and (2) consider adding an additional economic incentive for participants to submit information in all of the situations in which they are supposed to do so.\n\n\nSolidity specific recommendations\n\n\n\n\nThe following recommendations are specific to Solidity, but may also be instructive for developing smart contracts in other languages.\n\n\nEnforce invariants with \nassert()\n\n\nAn assert guard triggers when an assertion fails - such as an invariant property changing. For example, the token to ether issuance ratio, in a token issuance contract, may be fixed. You can verify that this is the case at all times with an \nassert()\n. Assert guards should often be combined with other techniques, such as pausing the contract and allowing upgrades. (Otherwise, you may end up stuck, with an assertion that is always failing.)\n\n\nExample:\n\n\ncontract\n \nToken\n \n{\n\n    \nmapping\n(\naddress\n \n=\n \nuint\n)\n \npublic\n \nbalanceOf\n;\n\n    \nuint\n \npublic\n \ntotalSupply\n;\n\n\n    \nfunction\n \ndeposit\n()\n \npublic\n \npayable\n \n{\n\n        \nbalanceOf\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n]\n \n+=\n \nmsg\n.\nvalue\n;\n\n        \ntotalSupply\n \n+=\n \nmsg\n.\nvalue\n;\n\n        \nassert\n(\nthis\n.\nbalance\n \n=\n \ntotalSupply\n);\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the assertion is \nnot\n a strict equality of the balance because the contract can be \nforcibly sent ether\n without going through the \ndeposit()\n function!\n\n\nUse \nassert()\n and \nrequire()\n properly\n\n\nIn Solidity 0.4.10 \nassert()\n and \nrequire()\n were introduced. \nrequire(condition)\n is meant to be used for input validation, which should be done on any user input, and reverts if the condition is false. \nassert(condition)\n also reverts if the condition is false but should be used only for invariants: internal errors or to check if your contract has reached an invalid state. Following this paradigm allows formal analysis tools to verify that the invalid opcode can never be reached: meaning no invariants in the code are violated and that the code is formally verified.\n\n\nBeware rounding with integer division\n\n\nAll integer division rounds down to the nearest integer. If you need more precision, consider using a multiplier, or store both the numerator and denominator.\n\n\n(In the future, Solidity will have a fixed-point type, which will make this easier.)\n\n\n// bad\n\n\nuint\n \nx\n \n=\n \n5\n \n/\n \n2\n;\n \n// Result is 2, all integer divison rounds DOWN to the nearest integer\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing a multiplier prevents rounding down, this multiplier needs to be accounted for when working with x in the future:\n\n\n// good\n\n\nuint\n \nmultiplier\n \n=\n \n10\n;\n\n\nuint\n \nx\n \n=\n \n(\n5\n \n*\n \nmultiplier\n)\n \n/\n \n2\n;\n\n\n\n\n\nStoring the numerator and denominator means you can calculate the result of \nnumerator/denominator\n off-chain:\n\n// good\n\n\nuint\n \nnumerator\n \n=\n \n5\n;\n\n\nuint\n \ndenominator\n \n=\n \n2\n;\n\n\n\n\nRemember that Ether can be forcibly sent to an account\n\n\nBeware of coding an invariant that strictly checks the balance of a contract.\n\n\nAn attacker can forcibly send wei to any account and this cannot be prevented (not even with a fallback function that does a \nrevert()\n).\n\n\nThe attacker can do this by creating a contract, funding it with 1 wei, and invoking\n\nselfdestruct(victimAddress)\n.  No code is invoked in \nvictimAddress\n, so it\ncannot be prevented.\n\n\nBe aware of the tradeoffs between abstract contracts and interfaces\n\n\nBoth interfaces and abstract contracts provide one with a customizable and re-usable approach for smart contracts. Interfaces, which were introduced in Solidity 0.4.11, are similar to abstract contracts but cannot have any functions implemented. Interfaces also have limitations such as not being able to access storage or inherit from other interfaces which generally makes abstract contracts more practical. Although, interfaces are certainly useful for designing contracts prior to implementation. Additionally, it is important to keep in mind that if a contract inherits from an abstract contract it must implement all non-implemented functions via overriding or it will be abstract as well.\n\n\nKeep fallback functions simple\n\n\nFallback functions\n are called when a contract is sent a message with no arguments (or when no function matches), and only has access to 2,300 gas when called from a \n.send()\n or \n.transfer()\n. If you wish to be able to receive Ether from a \n.send()\n or \n.transfer()\n, the most you can do in a fallback function is log an event. Use a proper function if a computation or more gas is required.\n\n\n// bad\n\n\nfunction\n()\n \npayable\n \n{\n \nbalances\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n]\n \n+=\n \nmsg\n.\nvalue\n;\n \n}\n\n\n\n// good\n\n\nfunction\n \ndeposit\n()\n \npayable\n \nexternal\n \n{\n \nbalances\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n]\n \n+=\n \nmsg\n.\nvalue\n;\n \n}\n\n\n\nfunction\n()\n \npayable\n \n{\n \nrequire\n(\nmsg\n.\ndata\n.\nlength\n \n==\n \n0\n);\n \nLogDepositReceived\n(\nmsg\n.\nsender\n);\n \n}\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck data length in fallback functions\n\n\nSince the \nfallback functions\n is not only called for plain ether transfers (without data) but also when no other function matches, you should check that the data is empty if the fallback function is intended to be used only for the purpose of logging received Ether. Otherwise, callers will not notice if your contract is used incorrectly and functions that do not exist are called.\n\n\n// bad\n\n\nfunction\n()\n \npayable\n \n{\n \nLogDepositReceived\n(\nmsg\n.\nsender\n);\n \n}\n\n\n\n// good\n\n\nfunction\n()\n \npayable\n \n{\n \nrequire\n(\nmsg\n.\ndata\n.\nlength\n \n==\n \n0\n);\n \nLogDepositReceived\n(\nmsg\n.\nsender\n);\n \n}\n\n\n\n\n\nExplicitly mark visibility in functions and state variables\n\n\nExplicitly label the visibility of functions and state variables. Functions can be specified as being \nexternal\n, \npublic\n, \ninternal\n or \nprivate\n. Please understand the differences between them, for example, \nexternal\n may be sufficient instead of \npublic\n. For state variables, \nexternal\n is not possible. Labeling the visibility explicitly will make it easier to catch incorrect assumptions about who can call the function or access the variable.\n\n\n// bad\n\n\nuint\n \nx\n;\n \n// the default is internal for state variables, but it should be made explicit\n\n\nfunction\n \nbuy\n()\n \n{\n \n// the default is public\n\n    \n// public code\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n// good\n\n\nuint\n \nprivate\n \ny\n;\n\n\nfunction\n \nbuy\n()\n \nexternal\n \n{\n\n    \n// only callable externally\n\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction\n \nutility\n()\n \npublic\n \n{\n\n    \n// callable externally, as well as internally: changing this code requires thinking about both cases.\n\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction\n \ninternalAction\n()\n \ninternal\n \n{\n\n    \n// internal code\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nLock pragmas to specific compiler version\n\n\nContracts should be deployed with the same compiler version and flags that they have been tested the most with. Locking the pragma helps ensure that contracts do not accidentally get deployed using, for example, the latest compiler which may have higher risks of undiscovered bugs. Contracts may also be deployed by others and the pragma indicates the compiler version intended by the original authors.\n\n\n// bad\n\n\npragma solidity\n \n^\n0\n.\n4\n.\n4\n;\n\n\n\n\n// good\n\n\npragma solidity\n \n0\n.\n4\n.\n4\n;\n\n\n\n\n\nException\n\n\nPragma statements can be allowed to float when a contract is intended for consumption by other developers, as in the case with contracts in a library or EthPM package. Otherwise, the developer would need to manually update the pragma in order to compile locally. \n\n\nDifferentiate functions and events\n\n\nFavor capitalization and a prefix in front of events (we suggest \nLog\n), to prevent the risk of confusion between functions and events. For functions, always start with a lowercase letter, except for the constructor.\n\n\n// bad\n\n\nevent\n \nTransfer\n()\n \n{}\n\n\nfunction\n \ntransfer\n()\n \n{}\n\n\n\n// good\n\n\nevent\n \nLogTransfer\n()\n \n{}\n\n\nfunction\n \ntransfer\n()\n \nexternal\n \n{}\n\n\n\n\n\nPrefer newer Solidity constructs\n\n\nPrefer constructs/aliases such as \nselfdestruct\n (over \nsuicide\n) and \nkeccak256\n (over \nsha3\n).  Patterns like \nrequire(msg.sender.send(1 ether))\n can also be simplified to using \ntransfer()\n, as in \nmsg.sender.transfer(1 ether)\n.\n\n\nBe aware that 'Built-ins' can be shadowed\n\n\nIt is currently possible to \nshadow\n built-in globals in Solidity. This allows contracts to override the functionality of built-ins such as \nmsg\n and \nrevert()\n.

Consider this \ncontract\n:\n\n\nuint256\n \nconstant\n \nprivate\n \nsalt\n \n=\n  \nblock\n.\ntimestamp\n;\n\n\n\nfunction\n \nrandom\n(\nuint\n \nMax\n)\n \nconstant\n \nprivate\n \nreturns\n \n(\nuint256\n \nresult\n){\n\n    \n//get the best seed for randomness\n\n    \nuint256\n \nx\n \n=\n \nsalt\n \n*\n \n100\n/\nMax\n;\n\n    \nuint256\n \ny\n \n=\n \nsalt\n \n*\n \nblock\n.\nnumber\n/\n(\nsalt\n \n%\n \n5\n)\n \n;\n\n    \nuint256\n \nseed\n \n=\n \nblock\n.\nnumber\n/\n3\n \n+\n \n(\nsalt\n \n%\n \n300\n)\n \n+\n \nLast_Payout\n \n+\n \ny\n;\n \n    \nuint256\n \nh\n \n=\n \nuint256\n(\nblock\n.\nblockhash\n(\nseed\n));\n \n\n    \nreturn\n \nuint256\n((\nh\n \n/\n \nx\n))\n \n%\n \nMax\n \n+\n \n1\n;\n \n//random number between 1 and Max\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the contract uses the timestamp to seed a random number, the miner can actually post a timestamp within 30 seconds of the block being validating, effectively allowing the miner to precompute an option more favorable to their chances in the lottery. Timestamps are not random and should not be used in that context.\n\n\n30-second Rule\n\n\nA general rule of thumb in evaluating timestamp usage is:\n\n\nIf the contract function can tolerate a \n30-second\n drift in time, it is safe to use \nblock.timestamp\n\n\nIf the scale of your time-dependent event can vary by 30-seconds and maintain integrity, it is safe to use a timestamp. This includes things like ending of auctions, registration periods, etc. \n\n\nCaution using \nblock.number\n as a timestamp\n\n\nWhen a contract creates an \nauction_complete\n modifier to signify the end of a token sale such as \nso\n\n\nmodifier\n \nauction_complete\n \n{\n\n    \nrequire\n(\nauctionEndBlock\n \n=\n \nblock\n.\nnumber\n     \n||\n\n          \ncurrentAuctionState\n \n==\n \nAuctionState\n.\nsuccess\n \n||\n \n          \ncurrentAuctionState\n \n==\n \nAuctionState\n.\ncancel\n)\n\n        \n_\n;}\n\n\n\n\nblock.number\n and \naverage block time\n can be used to estimate time as well, but this is not future proof as block times may change (such as \nfork reorganisations\n and the \ndifficulty bomb\n). In a sale spanning days, the 12-minute rule allows one to construct a more reliable estimate of time. \n\n\nMultiple Inheritance Caution\n\n\nWhen utilizing multiple inheritance in Solidity, it is important to understand how the compiler composes the inheritance graph.\n\n\ncontract\n \nFinal\n \n{\n\n    \nuint\n \npublic\n \na\n;\n\n    \nfunction\n \nFinal\n(\nuint\n \nf\n)\n \npublic\n \n{\n\n        \na\n \n=\n \nf\n;\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\ncontract\n \nB\n \nis\n \nFinal\n \n{\n\n    \nint\n \npublic\n \nfee\n;\n\n\n    \nfunction\n \nB\n(\nuint\n \nf\n)\n \nFinal\n(\nf\n)\n \npublic\n \n{\n\n    \n}\n\n    \nfunction\n \nsetFee\n()\n \npublic\n \n{\n\n        \nfee\n \n=\n \n3\n;\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\ncontract\n \nC\n \nis\n \nFinal\n \n{\n\n    \nint\n \npublic\n \nfee\n;\n\n\n    \nfunction\n \nC\n(\nuint\n \nf\n)\n \nFinal\n(\nf\n)\n \npublic\n \n{\n\n    \n}\n\n    \nfunction\n \nsetFee\n()\n \npublic\n \n{\n\n        \nfee\n \n=\n \n5\n;\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\ncontract\n \nA\n \nis\n \nB\n,\n \nC\n \n{\n\n  \nfunction\n \nA\n()\n \npublic\n \nB\n(\n3\n)\n \nC\n(\n5\n)\n \n{\n\n      \nsetFee\n();\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\nWhen A is deployed, the compiler will \nlinearize\n the inheritance from left to right, as:\n\n\nC -\n B -\n A\n\n\nThe consequence of the linearization will yield a \nfee\n value of 5, since C is the most derived contract. This may seem obvious, but imagine scenarios where C is able to shadow crucial functions, reorder boolean clauses, and cause the developer to write exploitable contracts.

The method by which random numbers are generated is itself an area of active research; current best-in-class solutions include Bitcoin block headers (verified through  http://btcrelay.org ), hash-commit-reveal schemes (ie. one party generates a number, publishes its hash to \"commit\" to the value, and then reveals the value later) and  RANDAO .  If you are implementing a frequent batch auction, a hash-commit scheme is also desirable.",

This issue may also arise in the context of state channel settlement. When such situations are an issue, (1) provide a way of circumventing non-participating participants, perhaps through a time limit, and (2) consider adding an additional economic incentive for participants to submit information in all of the situations in which they are supposed to do so.",

This class of bug can take many forms, and both of the major bugs that led to the DAO's collapse were bugs of this sort.\n\n\nReentrancy\n\n\nThe first version of this bug to be noticed involved functions that could be called repeatedly, before the first invocation of the function was finished. This may cause the different invocations of the function to interact in destructive ways.\n\n\n// INSECURE\n\n\nmapping\n \n(\naddress\n \n=\n \nuint\n)\n \nprivate\n \nuserBalances\n;\n\n\n\nfunction\n \nwithdrawBalance\n()\n \npublic\n \n{\n\n    \nuint\n \namountToWithdraw\n \n=\n \nuserBalances\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n];\n\n    \nrequire\n(\nmsg\n.\nsender\n.\ncall\n.\nvalue\n(\namountToWithdraw\n)());\n \n// At this point, the caller\ns code is executed, and can call withdrawBalance again\n\n    \nuserBalances\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n]\n \n=\n \n0\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the user's balance is not set to 0 until the very end of the function, the second (and later) invocations will still succeed, and will withdraw the balance over and over again. A very similar bug was one of the vulnerabilities in the DAO attack.\n\n\nIn the example given, the best way to avoid the problem is to \nuse \nsend()\n instead of \ncall.value()()\n. This will prevent any external code from being executed.\n\n\nHowever, if you can't remove the external call, the next simplest way to prevent this attack is to make sure you don't call an external function until you've done all the internal work you need to do:\n\n\nmapping\n \n(\naddress\n \n=\n \nuint\n)\n \nprivate\n \nuserBalances\n;\n\n\n\nfunction\n \nwithdrawBalance\n()\n \npublic\n \n{\n\n    \nuint\n \namountToWithdraw\n \n=\n \nuserBalances\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n];\n\n    \nuserBalances\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n]\n \n=\n \n0\n;\n\n    \nrequire\n(\nmsg\n.\nsender\n.\ncall\n.\nvalue\n(\namountToWithdraw\n)());\n \n// The user\ns balance is already 0, so future invocations won\nt withdraw anything\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that if you had another function which called \nwithdrawBalance()\n, it would be potentially subject to the same attack, so you must treat any function which calls an untrusted contract as itself untrusted. See below for further discussion of potential solutions.\n\n\nCross-function Race Conditions\n\n\nAn attacker may also be able to do a similar attack using two different functions that share the same state.\n\n\n// INSECURE\n\n\nmapping\n \n(\naddress\n \n=\n \nuint\n)\n \nprivate\n \nuserBalances\n;\n\n\n\nfunction\n \ntransfer\n(\naddress\n \nto\n,\n \nuint\n \namount\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nif\n \n(\nuserBalances\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n]\n \n=\n \namount\n)\n \n{\n\n       \nuserBalances\n[\nto\n]\n \n+=\n \namount\n;\n\n       \nuserBalances\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n]\n \n-=\n \namount\n;\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction\n \nwithdrawBalance\n()\n \npublic\n \n{\n\n    \nuint\n \namountToWithdraw\n \n=\n \nuserBalances\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n];\n\n    \nrequire\n(\nmsg\n.\nsender\n.\ncall\n.\nvalue\n(\namountToWithdraw\n)());\n \n// At this point, the caller\ns code is executed, and can call transfer()\n\n    \nuserBalances\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n]\n \n=\n \n0\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, the attacker calls \ntransfer()\n when their code is executed on the external call in \nwithdrawBalance\n. Since their balance has not yet been set to 0, they are able to transfer the tokens even though they already received the withdrawal. This vulnerability was also used in the DAO attack.\n\n\nThe same solutions will work, with the same caveats. Also note that in this example, both functions were part of the same contract. However, the same bug can occur across multiple contracts, if those contracts share state.\n\n\nPitfalls in Race Condition Solutions\n\n\nSince race conditions can occur across multiple functions, and even multiple contracts, any solution aimed at preventing reentry will not be sufficient.\n\n\nInstead, we have recommended finishing all internal work first, and only then calling the external function. This rule, if followed carefully, will allow you to avoid race conditions. However, you need to not only avoid calling external functions too soon, but also avoid calling functions which call external functions. For example, the following is insecure:\n\n\n// INSECURE\n\n\nmapping\n \n(\naddress\n \n=\n \nuint\n)\n \nprivate\n \nuserBalances\n;\n\n\nmapping\n \n(\naddress\n \n=\n \nbool\n)\n \nprivate\n \nclaimedBonus\n;\n\n\nmapping\n \n(\naddress\n \n=\n \nuint\n)\n \nprivate\n \nrewardsForA\n;\n\n\n\nfunction\n \nwithdraw\n(\naddress\n \nrecipient\n)\n \npublic\n \n{\n\n    \nuint\n \namountToWithdraw\n \n=\n \nuserBalances\n[\nrecipient\n];\n\n    \nrewardsForA\n[\nrecipient\n]\n \n=\n \n0\n;\n\n    \nrequire\n(\nrecipient\n.\ncall\n.\nvalue\n(\namountToWithdraw\n)());\n\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction\n \ngetFirstWithdrawalBonus\n(\naddress\n \nrecipient\n)\n \npublic\n \n{\n\n    \nrequire\n(\n!\nclaimedBonus\n[\nrecipient\n]);\n \n// Each recipient should only be able to claim the bonus once\n\n\n    \nrewardsForA\n[\nrecipient\n]\n \n+=\n \n100\n;\n\n    \nwithdraw\n(\nrecipient\n);\n \n// At this point, the caller will be able to execute getFirstWithdrawalBonus again.\n\n    \nclaimedBonus\n[\nrecipient\n]\n \n=\n \ntrue\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nEven though \ngetFirstWithdrawalBonus()\n doesn't directly call an external contract, the call in \nwithdraw()\n is enough to make it vulnerable to a race condition. You therefore need to treat \nwithdraw()\n as if it were also untrusted.\n\n\nmapping\n \n(\naddress\n \n=\n \nuint\n)\n \nprivate\n \nuserBalances\n;\n\n\nmapping\n \n(\naddress\n \n=\n \nbool\n)\n \nprivate\n \nclaimedBonus\n;\n\n\nmapping\n \n(\naddress\n \n=\n \nuint\n)\n \nprivate\n \nrewardsForA\n;\n\n\n\nfunction\n \nuntrustedWithdraw\n(\naddress\n \nrecipient\n)\n \npublic\n \n{\n\n    \nuint\n \namountToWithdraw\n \n=\n \nuserBalances\n[\nrecipient\n];\n\n    \nrewardsForA\n[\nrecipient\n]\n \n=\n \n0\n;\n\n    \nrequire\n(\nrecipient\n.\ncall\n.\nvalue\n(\namountToWithdraw\n)());\n\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction\n \nuntrustedGetFirstWithdrawalBonus\n(\naddress\n \nrecipient\n)\n \npublic\n \n{\n\n    \nrequire\n(\n!\nclaimedBonus\n[\nrecipient\n]);\n \n// Each recipient should only be able to claim the bonus once\n\n\n    \nclaimedBonus\n[\nrecipient\n]\n \n=\n \ntrue\n;\n\n    \nrewardsForA\n[\nrecipient\n]\n \n+=\n \n100\n;\n\n    \nuntrustedWithdraw\n(\nrecipient\n);\n \n// claimedBonus has been set to true, so reentry is impossible\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to the fix making reentry impossible, \nuntrusted functions have been marked\n. This same pattern repeats at every level: since \nuntrustedGetFirstWithdrawalBonus()\n calls \nuntrustedWithdraw()\n, which calls an external contract, you must also treat \nuntrustedGetFirstWithdrawalBonus()\n as insecure.\n\n\nAnother solution often suggested is a \nmutex\n. This allows you to \"lock\" some state so it can only be changed by the owner of the lock. A simple example might look like this:\n\n\n// Note: This is a rudimentary example, and mutexes are particularly useful where there is substantial logic and/or shared state\n\n\nmapping\n \n(\naddress\n \n=\n \nuint\n)\n \nprivate\n \nbalances\n;\n\n\nbool\n \nprivate\n \nlockBalances\n;\n\n\n\nfunction\n \ndeposit\n()\n \npayable\n \npublic\n \nreturns\n \n(\nbool\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nrequire\n(\n!\nlockBalances\n);\n\n    \nlockBalances\n \n=\n \ntrue\n;\n\n    \nbalances\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n]\n \n+=\n \nmsg\n.\nvalue\n;\n\n    \nlockBalances\n \n=\n \nfalse\n;\n\n    \nreturn\n \ntrue\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction\n \nwithdraw\n(\nuint\n \namount\n)\n \npayable\n \npublic\n \nreturns\n \n(\nbool\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nrequire\n(\n!\nlockBalances\n \n \namount\n \n \n0\n \n \nbalances\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n]\n \n=\n \namount\n);\n\n    \nlockBalances\n \n=\n \ntrue\n;\n\n\n    \nif\n \n(\nmsg\n.\nsender\n.\ncall\n(\namount\n)())\n \n{\n \n// Normally insecure, but the mutex saves it\n\n      \nbalances\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n]\n \n-=\n \namount\n;\n\n    \n}\n\n\n    \nlockBalances\n \n=\n \nfalse\n;\n\n    \nreturn\n \ntrue\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the user tries to call \nwithdraw()\n again before the first call finishes, the lock will prevent it from having any effect. This can be an effective pattern, but it gets tricky when you have multiple contracts that need to cooperate. The following is insecure:\n\n\n// INSECURE\n\n\ncontract\n \nStateHolder\n \n{\n\n    \nuint\n \nprivate\n \nn\n;\n\n    \naddress\n \nprivate\n \nlockHolder\n;\n\n\n    \nfunction\n \ngetLock\n()\n \n{\n\n        \nrequire\n(\nlockHolder\n \n==\n \n0\n);\n\n        \nlockHolder\n \n=\n \nmsg\n.\nsender\n;\n\n    \n}\n\n\n    \nfunction\n \nreleaseLock\n()\n \n{\n\n        \nrequire\n(\nmsg\n.\nsender\n \n==\n \nlockHolder\n);\n\n        \nlockHolder\n \n=\n \n0\n;\n\n    \n}\n\n\n    \nfunction\n \nset\n(\nuint\n \nnewState\n)\n \n{\n\n        \nrequire\n(\nmsg\n.\nsender\n \n==\n \nlockHolder\n);\n\n        \nn\n \n=\n \nnewState\n;\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nAn attacker can call \ngetLock()\n, and then never call \nreleaseLock()\n. If they do this, then the contract will be locked forever, and no further changes will be able to be made. If you use mutexes to protect against race conditions, you will need to carefully ensure that there are no ways for a lock to be claimed and never released. (There are other potential dangers when programming with mutexes, such as deadlocks and livelocks. You should consult the large amount of literature already written on mutexes, if you decide to go this route.)\n\n\n\n\n* Some may object to the use of the term \nrace condition\n since Ethereum does not currently have true parallelism. However, there is still the fundamental feature of logically distinct processes contending for resources, and the same sorts of pitfalls and potential solutions apply.\n\n\n\nTransaction-Ordering Dependence (TOD) / Front Running\n\n\nAbove were examples of race conditions involving the attacker executing malicious code \nwithin a single transaction\n. The following are a different type of race condition inherent to Blockchains: the fact that \nthe order of transactions themselves\n (within a block) is easily subject to manipulation.\n\n\nSince a transaction is in the mempool for a short while, one can know what actions will occur, before it is included in a block. This can be troublesome for things like decentralized markets, where a transaction to buy some tokens can be seen, and a market order implemented before the other transaction gets included. Protecting against this is difficult, as it would come down to the specific contract itself. For example, in markets, it would be better to implement batch auctions (this also protects against high frequency trading concerns). Another way to use a pre-commit scheme (\u201cI\u2019m going to submit the details later\u201d).\n\n\nTimestamp Dependence\n\n\nBe aware that the timestamp of the block can be manipulated by the miner, and all direct and indirect uses of the timestamp should be considered.\n\n\nSee the \nRecommendations\n section for design considerations related to Timestamp Dependence.\n\n\nInteger Overflow and Underflow\n\n\nConsider a simple token transfer:\n\n\nmapping\n \n(\naddress\n \n=\n \nuint256\n)\n \npublic\n \nbalanceOf\n;\n\n\n\n// INSECURE\n\n\nfunction\n \ntransfer\n(\naddress\n \n_to\n,\n \nuint256\n \n_value\n)\n \n{\n\n    \n/* Check if sender has balance */\n\n    \nrequire\n(\nbalanceOf\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n]\n \n=\n \n_value\n);\n\n    \n/* Add and subtract new balances */\n\n    \nbalanceOf\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n]\n \n-=\n \n_value\n;\n\n    \nbalanceOf\n[\n_to\n]\n \n+=\n \n_value\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n// SECURE\n\n\nfunction\n \ntransfer\n(\naddress\n \n_to\n,\n \nuint256\n \n_value\n)\n \n{\n\n    \n/* Check if sender has balance and for overflows */\n\n    \nrequire\n(\nbalanceOf\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n]\n \n=\n \n_value\n \n \nbalanceOf\n[\n_to\n]\n \n+\n \n_value\n \n=\n \nbalanceOf\n[\n_to\n]);\n\n\n    \n/* Add and subtract new balances */\n\n    \nbalanceOf\n[\nmsg\n.\nsender\n]\n \n-=\n \n_value\n;\n\n    \nbalanceOf\n[\n_to\n]\n \n+=\n \n_value\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nIf a balance reaches the maximum uint value (2^256) it will circle back to zero. This checks for that condition. This may or may not be relevant, depending on the implementation. Think about whether or not the uint value has an opportunity to approach such a large number. Think about how the uint variable changes state, and who has authority to make such changes. If any user can call functions which update the uint value, it's more vulnerable to attack. If only an admin has access to change the variable's state, you might be safe. If a user can increment by only 1 at a time, you are probably also safe because there is no feasible way to reach this limit.\n\n\nThe same is true for underflow. If a uint is made to be less than zero, it will cause an underflow and get set to its maximum value.\n\n\nBe careful with the smaller data-types like uint8, uint16, uint24...etc: they can even more easily hit their maximum value.\n\n\nBe aware there are around \n20 cases for overflow and underflow\n.\n\n\nUnderflow in Depth: Storage Manipulation\n\n\nDoug Hoyte's submission\n to the 2017 underhanded solidity contest received \nan honorable mention\n. The entry is interesting, because it raises the concerns about how C-like underflow might affect Solidity storage. Here is a simplified version:\n\n\ncontract\n \nUnderflowManipulation\n \n{\n\n    \naddress\n \npublic\n \nowner\n;\n\n    \nuint256\n \npublic\n \nmanipulateMe\n \n=\n \n10\n;\n\n    \nfunction\n \nUnderflowManipulation\n()\n \n{\n\n        \nowner\n \n=\n \nmsg\n.\nsender\n;\n\n    \n}\n\n\n    \nuint\n[]\n \npublic\n \nbonusCodes\n;\n\n\n    \nfunction\n \npushBonusCode\n(\nuint\n \ncode\n)\n \n{\n\n        \nbonusCodes\n.\npush\n(\ncode\n);\n\n    \n}\n\n\n    \nfunction\n \npopBonusCode\n()\n  \n{\n\n        \nrequire\n(\nbonusCodes\n.\nlength\n \n=\n0\n);\n  \n// this is a tautology\n\n        \nbonusCodes\n.\nlength\n--\n;\n \n// an underflow can be caused here\n\n    \n}\n\n\n    \nfunction\n \nmodifyBonusCode\n(\nuint\n \nindex\n,\n \nuint\n \nupdate\n)\n  \n{\n \n        \nrequire\n(\nindex\n \n \nbonusCodes\n.\nlength\n);\n\n        \nbonusCodes\n[\nindex\n]\n \n=\n \nupdate\n;\n \n// write to any index less than bonusCodes.length\n\n    \n}\n\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nIn general, the variable \nmanipulateMe\n's location cannot be influenced without going through the \nkeccak256\n, which is infeasible. However, since dynamic arrays are stored sequentially, if a malicious actor wanted to change \nmanipulateMe\n all they would need to do is:\n\n\n\n\nCall \npopBonusCode\n to underflow (Note: Solidity \nlacks a built-in pop method\n)\n\n\nCompute the storage location of \nmanipulateMe\n\n\nModify and update \nmanipulateMe\n's value using \nmodifyBonusCode\n\n\n\n\nIn practice, this array would be immediately pointed out as fishy, but buried under more complex smart contract architecture, it can arbitrarily allow malicious changes to constant variables.\n\n\nWhen considering use of a dynamic array, a container data scructure is a good practice. The Solidity CRUD \npart 1\n and \npart 2\n articles are good resources.\n\n\n\n\nDoS with (Unexpected) revert\n\n\nConsider a simple auction contract:\n\n\n// INSECURE\n\n\ncontract\n \nAuction\n \n{\n\n    \naddress\n \ncurrentLeader\n;\n\n    \nuint\n \nhighestBid\n;\n\n\n    \nfunction\n \nbid\n()\n \npayable\n \n{\n\n        \nrequire\n(\nmsg\n.\nvalue\n \n \nhighestBid\n);\n\n\n        \nrequire\n(\ncurrentLeader\n.\nsend\n(\nhighestBid\n));\n \n// Refund the old leader, if it fails then revert\n\n\n        \ncurrentLeader\n \n=\n \nmsg\n.\nsender\n;\n\n        \nhighestBid\n \n=\n \nmsg\n.\nvalue\n;\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen it tries to refund the old leader, it reverts if the refund fails. This means that a malicious bidder can become the leader while making sure that any refunds to their address will \nalways\n fail. In this way, they can prevent anyone else from calling the \nbid()\n function, and stay the leader forever. A recommendation is to set up a \npull payment system\n instead, as described earlier.\n\n\nAnother example is when a contract may iterate through an array to pay users (e.g., supporters in a crowdfunding contract). It's common to want to make sure that each payment succeeds. If not, one should revert. The issue is that if one call fails, you are reverting the whole payout system, meaning the loop will never complete. No one gets paid because one address is forcing an error.\n\n\naddress\n[]\n \nprivate\n \nrefundAddresses\n;\n\n\nmapping\n \n(\naddress\n \n=\n \nuint\n)\n \npublic\n \nrefunds\n;\n\n\n\n// bad\n\n\nfunction\n \nrefundAll\n()\n \npublic\n \n{\n\n    \nfor\n(\nuint\n \nx\n;\n \nx\n \n \nrefundAddresses\n.\nlength\n;\n \nx\n++\n)\n \n{\n \n// arbitrary length iteration based on how many addresses participated\n\n        \nrequire\n(\nrefundAddresses\n[\nx\n].\nsend\n(\nrefunds\n[\nrefundAddresses\n[\nx\n]]))\n \n// doubly bad, now a single failure on send will hold up all funds\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, the recommended solution is to \nfavor pull over push payments\n.\n\n\nDoS with Block Gas Limit\n\n\nYou may have noticed another problem with the previous example: by paying out to everyone at once, you risk running into the block gas limit. Each Ethereum block can process a certain maximum amount of computation. If you try to go over that, your transaction will fail.\n\n\nThis can lead to problems even in the absence of an intentional attack. However, it's especially bad if an attacker can manipulate the amount of gas needed. In the case of the previous example, the attacker could add a bunch of addresses, each of which needs to get a very small refund. The gas cost of refunding each of the attacker's addresses could, therefore, end up being more than the gas limit, blocking the refund transaction from happening at all.\n\n\nThis is another reason to \nfavor pull over push payments\n.\n\n\nIf you absolutely must loop over an array of unknown size, then you should plan for it to potentially take multiple blocks, and therefore require multiple transactions. You will need to keep track of how far you've gone, and be able to resume from that point, as in the following example:\n\n\nstruct\n \nPayee\n \n{\n\n    \naddress\n \naddr\n;\n\n    \nuint256\n \nvalue\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\nPayee\n[]\n \npayees\n;\n\n\nuint256\n \nnextPayeeIndex\n;\n\n\n\nfunction\n \npayOut\n()\n \n{\n\n    \nuint256\n \ni\n \n=\n \nnextPayeeIndex\n;\n\n    \nwhile\n \n(\ni\n \n \npayees\n.\nlength\n \n \nmsg\n.\ngas\n \n \n200000\n)\n \n{\n\n      \npayees\n[\ni\n].\naddr\n.\nsend\n(\npayees\n[\ni\n].\nvalue\n);\n\n      \ni\n++\n;\n\n    \n}\n\n    \nnextPayeeIndex\n \n=\n \ni\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will need to make sure that nothing bad will happen if other transactions are processed while waiting for the next iteration of the \npayOut()\n function. So only use this pattern if absolutely necessary.\n\n\nForcibly Sending Ether to a Contract\n\n\nIt is possible to forcibly send Ether to a contract without triggering its fallback function. This is an important consideration when placing important logic in the fallback function or making calculations based on a contract's balance. Take the following example:\n\n\ncontract\n \nVulnerable\n \n{\n\n    \nfunction\n \n()\n \npayable\n \n{\n\n        \nrevert\n();\n\n    \n}\n\n\n    \nfunction\n \nsomethingBad\n()\n \n{\n\n        \nrequire\n(\nthis\n.\nbalance\n \n \n0\n);\n\n        \n// Do something bad\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nContract logic seems to disallow payments to the contract and therefore disallow \"something bad\" from happening. However, a few methods exist for forcibly sending ether to the contract and therefore making its balance greater than zero. \n\n\nThe \nselfdestruct\n contract method allows a user to specify a beneficiary to send any excess ether. \nselfdestruct\n \ndoes not trigger a contract's fallback function\n. \n\n\nIt is also possible to \nprecompute\n a contract's address and send Ether to that address before deploying the contract.\n\n\nContract developers should be aware that Ether can be forcibly sent to a contract and should design contract logic accordingly. Generally, assume that it is not possible to restrict sources of funding to your contract. \n\n\nDeprecated/historical attacks\n\n\nThese are attacks which are no longer possible due to changes in the protocol or improvements to solidity. They are recorded here for posterity and awareness. \n\n\nCall Depth Attack (deprecated)\n\n\nAs of the \nEIP 150\n hardfork, call depth attacks are no longer relevant\n*\n (all gas would be consumed well before reaching the 1024 call depth limit).",

Instead, we have recommended finishing all internal work first, and only then calling the external function. This rule, if followed carefully, will allow you to avoid race conditions. However, you need to not only avoid calling external functions too soon, but also avoid calling functions which call external functions. For example, the following is insecure:  // INSECURE  mapping   ( address   =   uint )   private   userBalances ;  mapping   ( address   =   bool )   private   claimedBonus ;  mapping   ( address   =   uint )   private   rewardsForA ;  function   withdraw ( address   recipient )   public   { \n     uint   amountToWithdraw   =   userBalances [ recipient ]; \n     rewardsForA [ recipient ]   =   0 ; \n     require ( recipient . call . value ( amountToWithdraw )());  }  function   getFirstWithdrawalBonus ( address   recipient )   public   { \n     require ( ! claimedBonus [ recipient ]);   // Each recipient should only be able to claim the bonus once \n\n     rewardsForA [ recipient ]   +=   100 ; \n     withdraw ( recipient );   // At this point, the caller will be able to execute getFirstWithdrawalBonus again. \n     claimedBonus [ recipient ]   =   true ;  }   Even though  getFirstWithdrawalBonus()  doesn't directly call an external contract, the call in  withdraw()  is enough to make it vulnerable to a race condition.

This same pattern repeats at every level: since  untrustedGetFirstWithdrawalBonus()  calls  untrustedWithdraw() , which calls an external contract, you must also treat  untrustedGetFirstWithdrawalBonus()  as insecure.  Another solution often suggested is a  mutex . This allows you to \"lock\" some state so it can only be changed by the owner of the lock. A simple example might look like this:  // Note: This is a rudimentary example, and mutexes are particularly useful where there is substantial logic and/or shared state  mapping   ( address   =   uint )   private   balances ;  bool   private   lockBalances ;  function   deposit ()   payable   public   returns   ( bool )   { \n     require ( ! lockBalances ); \n     lockBalances   =   true ; \n     balances [ msg . sender ]   +=   msg . value ; \n     lockBalances   =   false ; \n     return   true ;  }  function   withdraw ( uint   amount )   payable   public   returns   ( bool )   { \n     require ( ! lockBalances     amount     0     balances [ msg . sender ]   =   amount ); \n     lockBalances   =   true ; \n\n     if   ( msg . sender . call ( amount )())   {   // Normally insecure, but the mutex saves it \n       balances [ msg . sender ]   -=   amount ; \n     } \n\n     lockBalances   =   false ; \n     return   true ;  }   If the user tries to call  withdraw()  again before the first call finishes, the lock will prevent it from having any effect. This can be an effective pattern, but it gets tricky when you have multiple contracts that need to cooperate. The following is insecure:  // INSECURE  contract   StateHolder   { \n     uint   private   n ; \n     address   private   lockHolder ; \n\n     function   getLock ()   { \n         require ( lockHolder   ==   0 ); \n         lockHolder   =   msg . sender ; \n     } \n\n     function   releaseLock ()   { \n         require ( msg . sender   ==   lockHolder ); \n         lockHolder   =   0 ; \n     } \n\n     function   set ( uint   newState )   { \n         require ( msg . sender   ==   lockHolder ); \n         n   =   newState ; \n     }  }   An attacker can call  getLock() , and then never call  releaseLock() . If they do this, then the contract will be locked forever, and no further changes will be able to be made. If you use mutexes to protect against race conditions, you will need to carefully ensure that there are no ways for a lock to be claimed and never released. (There are other potential dangers when programming with mutexes, such as deadlocks and livelocks. You should consult the large amount of literature already written on mutexes, if you decide to go this route.)   * Some may object to the use of the term  race condition  since Ethereum does not currently have true parallelism. However, there is still the fundamental feature of logically distinct processes contending for resources, and the same sorts of pitfalls and potential solutions apply.",

This checks for that condition. This may or may not be relevant, depending on the implementation. Think about whether or not the uint value has an opportunity to approach such a large number. Think about how the uint variable changes state, and who has authority to make such changes. If any user can call functions which update the uint value, it's more vulnerable to attack. If only an admin has access to change the variable's state, you might be safe. If a user can increment by only 1 at a time, you are probably also safe because there is no feasible way to reach this limit.  The same is true for underflow. If a uint is made to be less than zero, it will cause an underflow and get set to its maximum value.

However, since dynamic arrays are stored sequentially, if a malicious actor wanted to change  manipulateMe  all they would need to do is:   Call  popBonusCode  to underflow (Note: Solidity  lacks a built-in pop method )  Compute the storage location of  manipulateMe  Modify and update  manipulateMe 's value using  modifyBonusCode   In practice, this array would be immediately pointed out as fishy, but buried under more complex smart contract architecture, it can arbitrarily allow malicious changes to constant variables.

In this way, they can prevent anyone else from calling the  bid()  function, and stay the leader forever. A recommendation is to set up a  pull payment system  instead, as described earlier.  Another example is when a contract may iterate through an array to pay users (e.g., supporters in a crowdfunding contract). It's common to want to make sure that each payment succeeds. If not, one should revert. The issue is that if one call fails, you are reverting the whole payout system, meaning the loop will never complete.

Each Ethereum block can process a certain maximum amount of computation. If you try to go over that, your transaction will fail.  This can lead to problems even in the absence of an intentional attack. However, it's especially bad if an attacker can manipulate the amount of gas needed. In the case of the previous example, the attacker could add a bunch of addresses, each of which needs to get a very small refund. The gas cost of refunding each of the attacker's addresses could, therefore, end up being more than the gas limit, blocking the refund transaction from happening at all.  This is another reason to  favor pull over push payments .  If you absolutely must loop over an array of unknown size, then you should plan for it to potentially take multiple blocks, and therefore require multiple transactions. You will need to keep track of how far you've gone, and be able to resume from that point, as in the following example:  struct   Payee   { \n     address   addr ; \n     uint256   value ;  }  Payee []   payees ;  uint256   nextPayeeIndex ;  function   payOut ()   { \n     uint256   i   =   nextPayeeIndex ; \n     while   ( i     payees . length     msg . gas     200000 )   { \n       payees [ i ]. addr . send ( payees [ i ]. value ); \n       i ++ ; \n     } \n     nextPayeeIndex   =   i ;  }   You will need to make sure that nothing bad will happen if other transactions are processed while waiting for the next iteration of the  payOut()  function.

Since the cost of failure on a blockchain can be very high, you must also adapt the way you write software, to account for that risk.\n\n\nThe approach we advocate is to \"prepare for failure\". It is impossible to know in advance whether your code is secure. However, you can architect your contracts in a way that allows them to fail gracefully, and with minimal damage. This section presents a variety of techniques that will help you prepare for failure.\n\n\nNote: There's always a risk when you add a new component to your system. A badly designed fail-safe could itself become a vulnerability - as can the interaction between a number of well designed fail-safes. Be thoughtful about each technique you use in your contracts, and consider carefully how they work together to create a robust system.\n\n\nUpgrading Broken Contracts\n\n\nCode will need to be changed if errors are discovered or if improvements need to be made. It is no good to discover a bug, but have no way to deal with it.\n\n\nDesigning an effective upgrade system for smart contracts is an area of active research, and we won't be able to cover all of the complications in this document. However, there are two basic approaches that are most commonly used. The simpler of the two is to have a registry contract that holds the address of the latest version of the contract. A more seamless approach for contract users is to have a contract that forwards calls and data onto the latest version of the contract.\n\n\nWhatever the technique, it's important to have modularization and good separation between components, so that code changes do not break functionality, orphan data, or require substantial costs to port. In particular, it is usually beneficial to separate complex logic from your data storage, so that you do not have to recreate all of the data in order to change the functionality.\n\n\nIt's also critical to have a secure way for parties to decide to upgrade the code. Depending on your contract, code changes may need to be approved by a single trusted party, a group of members, or a vote of the full set of stakeholders. If this process can take some time, you will want to consider if there are other ways to react more quickly in case of an attack, such as an \nemergency stop or circuit-breaker\n.\n\n\nExample 1: Use a registry contract to store latest version of a contract\n\n\nIn this example, the calls aren't forwarded, so users should fetch the current address each time before interacting with it.\n\n\ncontract\n \nSomeRegister\n \n{\n\n    \naddress\n \nbackendContract\n;\n\n    \naddress\n[]\n \npreviousBackends\n;\n\n    \naddress\n \nowner\n;\n\n\n    \nfunction\n \nSomeRegister\n()\n \n{\n\n        \nowner\n \n=\n \nmsg\n.\nsender\n;\n\n    \n}\n\n\n    \nmodifier\n \nonlyOwner\n()\n \n{\n\n        \nrequire\n(\nmsg\n.\nsender\n \n==\n \nowner\n)\n\n        \n_\n;\n\n    \n}\n\n\n    \nfunction\n \nchangeBackend\n(\naddress\n \nnewBackend\n)\n \npublic\n\n    \nonlyOwner\n()\n\n    \nreturns\n \n(\nbool\n)\n\n    \n{\n\n        \nif\n(\nnewBackend\n \n!=\n \nbackendContract\n)\n \n{\n\n            \npreviousBackends\n.\npush\n(\nbackendContract\n);\n\n            \nbackendContract\n \n=\n \nnewBackend\n;\n\n            \nreturn\n \ntrue\n;\n\n        \n}\n\n\n        \nreturn\n \nfalse\n;\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are two main disadvantages to this approach:\n\n\n\n\nUsers must always look up the current address, and anyone who fails to do so risks using an old version of the contract\n\n\nYou will need to think carefully about how to deal with the contract data when you replace the contract\n\n\n\n\nThe alternate approach is to have a contract forward calls and data to the latest version of the contract:\n\n\nExample 2: \nUse a \nDELEGATECALL\n to forward data and calls\n\n\ncontract\n \nRelay\n \n{\n\n    \naddress\n \npublic\n \ncurrentVersion\n;\n\n    \naddress\n \npublic\n \nowner\n;\n\n\n    \nmodifier\n \nonlyOwner\n()\n \n{\n\n        \nrequire\n(\nmsg\n.\nsender\n \n==\n \nowner\n);\n\n        \n_\n;\n\n    \n}\n\n\n    \nfunction\n \nRelay\n(\naddress\n \ninitAddr\n)\n \n{\n\n        \ncurrentVersion\n \n=\n \ninitAddr\n;\n\n        \nowner\n \n=\n \nmsg\n.\nsender\n;\n \n// this owner may be another contract with multisig, not a single contract owner\n\n    \n}\n\n\n    \nfunction\n \nchangeContract\n(\naddress\n \nnewVersion\n)\n \npublic\n\n    \nonlyOwner\n()\n\n    \n{\n\n        \ncurrentVersion\n \n=\n \nnewVersion\n;\n\n    \n}\n\n\n    \nfunction\n()\n \n{\n\n        \nrequire\n(\ncurrentVersion\n.\ndelegatecall\n(\nmsg\n.\ndata\n));\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nThis approach avoids the previous problems but has problems of its own. You must be extremely careful with how you store data in this contract. If your new contract has a different storage layout than the first, your data may end up corrupted. Additionally, this simple version of the pattern cannot return values from functions, only forward them, which limits its applicability. (\nMore complex implementations\n attempt to solve this with in-line assembly code and a registry of return sizes.)\n\n\nRegardless of your approach, it is important to have some way to upgrade your contracts, or they will become unusable when the inevitable bugs are discovered in them.\n\n\nCircuit Breakers (Pause contract functionality)\n\n\nCircuit breakers stop execution if certain conditions are met, and can be useful when new errors are discovered. For example, most actions may be suspended in a contract if a bug is discovered, and the only action now active is a withdrawal. You can either give certain trusted parties the ability to trigger the circuit breaker or else have programmatic rules that automatically trigger the certain breaker when certain conditions are met.\n\n\nExample:\n\n\nbool\n \nprivate\n \nstopped\n \n=\n \nfalse\n;\n\n\naddress\n \nprivate\n \nowner\n;\n\n\n\nmodifier\n \nisAdmin\n()\n \n{\n\n    \nrequire\n(\nmsg\n.\nsender\n \n==\n \nowner\n);\n\n    \n_\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction\n \ntoggleContractActive\n()\n \nisAdmin\n \npublic\n \n{\n\n    \n// You can add an additional modifier that restricts stopping a contract to be based on another action, such as a vote of users\n\n    \nstopped\n \n=\n \n!\nstopped\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\nmodifier\n \nstopInEmergency\n \n{\n \nif\n \n(\n!\nstopped\n)\n \n_\n;\n \n}\n\n\nmodifier\n \nonlyInEmergency\n \n{\n \nif\n \n(\nstopped\n)\n \n_\n;\n \n}\n\n\n\nfunction\n \ndeposit\n()\n \nstopInEmergency\n \npublic\n \n{\n\n    \n// some code\n\n\n}\n\n\n\nfunction\n \nwithdraw\n()\n \nonlyInEmergency\n \npublic\n \n{\n\n    \n// some code\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeed Bumps (Delay contract actions)\n\n\nSpeed bumps slow down actions, so that if malicious actions occur, there is time to recover. For example, \nThe DAO\n required 27 days between a successful request to split the DAO and the ability to do so. This ensured the funds were kept within the contract, increasing the likelihood of recovery.

            "text": "Code will need to be changed if errors are discovered or if improvements need to be made. It is no good to discover a bug, but have no way to deal with it.  Designing an effective upgrade system for smart contracts is an area of active research, and we won't be able to cover all of the complications in this document. However, there are two basic approaches that are most commonly used. The simpler of the two is to have a registry contract that holds the address of the latest version of the contract. A more seamless approach for contract users is to have a contract that forwards calls and data onto the latest version of the contract.  Whatever the technique, it's important to have modularization and good separation between components, so that code changes do not break functionality, orphan data, or require substantial costs to port. In particular, it is usually beneficial to separate complex logic from your data storage, so that you do not have to recreate all of the data in order to change the functionality.  It's also critical to have a secure way for parties to decide to upgrade the code. Depending on your contract, code changes may need to be approved by a single trusted party, a group of members, or a vote of the full set of stakeholders. If this process can take some time, you will want to consider if there are other ways to react more quickly in case of an attack, such as an  emergency stop or circuit-breaker .  Example 1: Use a registry contract to store latest version of a contract  In this example, the calls aren't forwarded, so users should fetch the current address each time before interacting with it.  contract   SomeRegister   { \n     address   backendContract ; \n     address []   previousBackends ; \n     address   owner ; \n\n     function   SomeRegister ()   { \n         owner   =   msg . sender ; \n     } \n\n     modifier   onlyOwner ()   { \n         require ( msg . sender   ==   owner ) \n         _ ; \n     } \n\n     function   changeBackend ( address   newBackend )   public \n     onlyOwner () \n     returns   ( bool ) \n     { \n         if ( newBackend   !=   backendContract )   { \n             previousBackends . push ( backendContract ); \n             backendContract   =   newBackend ; \n             return   true ; \n         } \n\n         return   false ; \n     }  }   There are two main disadvantages to this approach:   Users must always look up the current address, and anyone who fails to do so risks using an old version of the contract  You will need to think carefully about how to deal with the contract data when you replace the contract   The alternate approach is to have a contract forward calls and data to the latest version of the contract:  Example 2:  Use a  DELEGATECALL  to forward data and calls  contract   Relay   { \n     address   public   currentVersion ; \n     address   public   owner ; \n\n     modifier   onlyOwner ()   { \n         require ( msg . sender   ==   owner ); \n         _ ; \n     } \n\n     function   Relay ( address   initAddr )   { \n         currentVersion   =   initAddr ; \n         owner   =   msg . sender ;   // this owner may be another contract with multisig, not a single contract owner \n     } \n\n     function   changeContract ( address   newVersion )   public \n     onlyOwner () \n     { \n         currentVersion   =   newVersion ; \n     } \n\n     function ()   { \n         require ( currentVersion . delegatecall ( msg . data )); \n     }  }   This approach avoids the previous problems but has problems of its own. You must be extremely careful with how you store data in this contract. If your new contract has a different storage layout than the first, your data may end up corrupted. Additionally, this simple version of the pattern cannot return values from functions, only forward them, which limits its applicability. ( More complex implementations  attempt to solve this with in-line assembly code and a registry of return sizes.)  Regardless of your approach, it is important to have some way to upgrade your contracts, or they will become unusable when the inevitable bugs are discovered in them.",

For example, most actions may be suspended in a contract if a bug is discovered, and the only action now active is a withdrawal.

Example:  bool   private   stopped   =   false ;  address   private   owner ;  modifier   isAdmin ()   { \n     require ( msg . sender   ==   owner ); \n     _ ;  }  function   toggleContractActive ()   isAdmin   public   { \n     // You can add an additional modifier that restricts stopping a contract to be based on another action, such as a vote of users \n     stopped   =   ! stopped ;  }  modifier   stopInEmergency   {   if   ( ! stopped )   _ ;   }  modifier   onlyInEmergency   {   if   ( stopped )   _ ;   }  function   deposit ()   stopInEmergency   public   { \n     // some code  }  function   withdraw ()   onlyInEmergency   public   { \n     // some code  }",
